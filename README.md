##Ideology
 Agriculture is the Backbone of world economy especially in India. It is the most significant and privileged occupation, agriculture is facing  a lot crises , so its becoming hard to enhance profit with production ,By taking these into consideration, we include IOT and Machine Learning to treat crop and irrigating  with adequate nutrients and pesticides according to weather conditions around, for efficient crop production also the weather conditions, interpret the soil, crops for farming, these are some terms of precision farming. The farming uses data analytics and collection of data. And the treatment of crop is based on historic data by using some supervised machine learning algorithms and also some IOT kind of sensor devices. In addition to that, this paper mainly focuses on the dataset of the crop and also it checks over the condition of the plant and entire crop cultivation, using the computer vision. It is recommended to predict the plant diseases at their early stage in this field of farming. The idea behind this paper is to bring awareness among farmers about the technologies to reduce diseases in plants. Here, the approaches of machine learning and image processing included with an accurate algorithm is to identified to detect the leaf diseases. This would help in behind of farming, to the farmers with a sophisticated pre-plan the activities before going to do the cultivation which should be integrated with the optimized solution in the farming.
